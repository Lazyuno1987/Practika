        Michael Joseph Jackson[9][10] was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958.[11][12] He was the eighth of
        ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson
        Street.[13][14] His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a
        country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.[15] She was a Jehovah's Witness.[16] His father, Joseph
        Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues
        band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.[17][18] Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army
        scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man.[19] Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie,
        La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).[17] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin
        Brandon, died shortly after birth.[20]</li>
        <li>Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.[30] In 1965,
        the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song "Barefootin'" and sang the
        Temptations' "My Girl".[31] From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of
        black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight,
        and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at
        local auditoriums and high school dances.[32][33] In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly
        amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem</li>
        <li>The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records; their first single, "Big Boy", was
        released in 1968.[36] Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after they opened
        for Taylor at Chicago's Regal Theater in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a
        version of "Who's Lovin' You".[37] After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles.[38] In 1969,
        Motown executives decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public—partly to bolster her career in
        television—sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its "production line".[39] The Jackson 5 made their
        first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss Black America pageant, performing a cover of "It's Your Thing".[40]
        Rolling Stone later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts" who "quickly emerged as
        the main draw and lead singer</li>
        <li>n January 1970, "I Want You Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; it
        stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "ABC", "The Love You Save", and "I'll Be
        There".[42] In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house on a two-acre estate in Encino, California.[43]
        During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen idol.[44] Between 1972 and 1975, he released
        four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973), and Forever, Michael
        (1975).[45] "Got to Be There" and "Ben", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a
        cover of Bobby Day's "Rockin' Robin"</li>
        <li>Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5.[45] The Jackson 5 were later described as "a cutting-edge example of black
        crossover artists".[47] They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input.[48] Jackson's performance
        of their top five single "Dancing Machine" on Soul Train popularized the robot dance.</li>
        <li>In 1975, the Jackson 5 left Motown. They signed with Epic Records, a subsidiary of CBS Records,[50] and renamed
        themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and
        pursued a solo career.[51] The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and
        1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"
        (1978), "This Place Hotel" (1980), and "Can You Feel It" (1980).</li>
